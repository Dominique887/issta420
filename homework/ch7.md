## CH7


1. The use of applying data-analysis calculations in a flexible and efficient manner/uses the clause over for window/performing a set calculation and returns a single value

2. a subset that restricts a window by rows that have the same values in the partitioning columns as in the current row

3. in a window aggregate function window ordering supports a frame specification

4. filters a frame or burst of rows from the window partition between the two specific delimiters

5. ranking window functions to rank each row with respect to others in the window when you would need to assign incremental sequential integers to rows

6. use off set window functions to return an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the current row at the beginning or end of a window frame

7. support window partitions and window order clauses pg219

8. functions to return an element from the first and last rows in the window frame , respectively

9. aggregate the values in the defined window

10. data involves rotating data from a state of rows to a state of columns,possibly aggregating values along the way
